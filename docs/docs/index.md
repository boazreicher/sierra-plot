# Sierra Plot

Sierra Plot is a Grafan panel plugin for visualizing datasets containing a very large number of series
<br>
A Sierra Plot is an extension of the [Ridgeline Plot](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/joyplots.html)[^1], with a number of additional elements, most notably:
<ul>
<li>An added chart showing the totals across all of the different series</li>
<li><a href="features/#fog">Fog</a> for highlighting values above some threshold</li>
<li>Grouping</li>
<li>And much <a href="features/">more</a></li>
</ul>
